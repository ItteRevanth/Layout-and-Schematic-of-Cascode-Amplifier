# Layout-and-Schematic-of-Cascode-Amplifier
- Designed the cascode amplifier with cascode current mirror and beta multiplier.
- Designed with constraints as:
   i. Gain = 20 V/V
  ii. UGB frequency >= 500kHz
  iii. Power Consumption <= 5mW
- Simulated the schmeatic on LTspice for transient and AC analysis.
- Designed the layout of above circuits on magic tool for 180nm technology.
- Ran the LVS check on NgSpice.
